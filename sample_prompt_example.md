## Why You Might Still See Similar Results

1. **API Key Issues**: If the API key is missing/invalid, it falls back to templates
2. **AI Response Parsing**: If AI doesn't return valid JSON, it uses fallbacks
3. **Limited Ingredient Variety**: Similar ingredients = similar base recipes
4. **Fallback Templates**: The fallback system still uses the old template system

## To Test the AI Integration:

1. Open browser dev tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. (Legacy) Use the meal prep generator
4. Look for logs starting with "ðŸ¤– AI Prompt" and "ðŸ¤– AI Response"
5. This will show you exactly what's being sent to and received from the AI
